### Cross-Chain Leasing Protocol on Nolus for Optimism

The proposed cross-chain leasing protocol built on the Nolus protocol aims to facilitate asset leasing on the **Optimism** network. This protocol will leverage **precompiles** to streamline interactions between Nolus and Optimism, enabling seamless asset management and lending functionalities.

### Overview of the Cross-Chain Leasing Protocol
The cross-chain leasing protocol will allow users to lease assets from Nolus while utilizing the liquidity and trading capabilities of Optimism. 
This integration will enhance the user experience by providing access to a broader market while maintaining ownership of the leased assets. The protocol will utilize precompiles to handle critical operations efficiently, ensuring low latency and reduced transaction costs.

### Key Components of the Protocol
**Nolus Lease Smart Contract:**
Manages the leasing agreements, including collateral management, loan issuance, and repayment processes.
Implements partial liquidation strategies to mitigate risks for borrowers.

**Optimism Integration Layer:**
Facilitates communication between Nolus and Optimism using Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocols.
Ensures that transactions can be executed on both chains without compromising security or efficiency.

**Precompiles:**
Special smart contracts deployed on Optimism that handle specific operations related to asset leasing, such as asset transfers and state updates.

These precompiles will enable efficient cross-chain messaging and execution of commands without requiring complex logic on the main chain.

### Sample Precompiles for the Protocol
To facilitate the cross-chain leasing protocol, several precompiles will be defined. Below are examples of potential precompiles that could be implemented on Optimism:
**1. Asset Transfer Precompile:**

- Functionality: Allows for the secure transfer of assets from Nolus to Optimism.
- Example Function:
  ```
  function transferAsset(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
  external returns (bool);
```
```

- Purpose: Ensures that assets can be moved seamlessly between chains while maintaining ownership records.

**2. Lease Agreement Precompile:**
